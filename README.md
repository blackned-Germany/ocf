# OpenCard Framework Service

The OpenCard Framework (OCF) is a smart card middleware implemented in Java. The framework allows a smart card aware
application to access contact and contactless cards that implement commands using Application Protocol Data Units
(APDUs) as defined by ISO/IEC 7816-4, -8 and -9.
