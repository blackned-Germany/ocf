/**
 * Provides specific smart card functionality to applications.
 * This functionality may be, for example, an ISO 7816-4 file system or
 * a ISO 7816-7 data base system. A concrete card service is almost
 * always smart card operating system specific.
 *
 * <p>
 * Communication with a smart card takes place through a <tt>CardChannel</tt>
 * that the card service either allocates from a <tt>CardServiceScheduler</tt>
 * or gets from a third party, for example another card service or the
 * corresponding <tt>SmartCard</tt> object if <tt>beginMutex</tt> is
 * invoked there.
 * <br>
 * The methods to allocate and release card channels provided here are
 * aware of channels that have been pre-set by a third party. A public
 * method providing card functionality in a class derived from
 * <tt>CardService</tt> will typically have the following structure:
 * <p>
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * public RetType doSomeThingWithCard(...)
 *     throws CardServiceException, CardTerminalException
 * {
 *   ... // check parameters
 *   RetType retvalue = null;
 *   try {
 *     allocateCardChannel(); // ensure there is a channel
 *     CommandAPDU  command  = ...;
 *     ResponseAPDU response =
 *              getCardChannel().sendCommandAPDU(command);
 *     ... // evaluate response, maybe send further commands
 *     retvalue = ...;
 *   } finally {             // despite any exceptions
 *     releaseCardChannel(); // free the card channel
 *   }
 *   return retvalue;
 * }

   * used to issue a series of commands to the smartcard that has to
   * or should be processed without intervening commands, for example
   * to avoid additional SELECT operations or multiple password queries
   * that would have to be performed by the service otherwise.
   * <br>
   * This method is typically invoked from <tt>SmartCard.beginMutex</tt>.
   * All services used by an application will be provided with the same
   * channel, and no other application will have access to the smartcard
   * (unless it supports multiple logical channels). A second use for
   * this method are services that are built on top of other services
   * and provide their own channel, the so-called <i>meta services</i>.

   * and <tt>realeaseCardChannel</tt> cannot be invoked. Their implementation
   * in this class just avoids the invocations of the scheduler if a channel
   * is already available. They still check whether the scheduler is alive,
   * or whether it has died since the smartcard has been removed.
   * Derived services may add more functionality there, making the invocation
   * of those methods necessary even if a channel has been pre-set.
   * <br>
   * This method has intentionally not been declared <tt>final</tt>.
   * A service that uses customized channels may want to prepare the
   * channel for future use here.
