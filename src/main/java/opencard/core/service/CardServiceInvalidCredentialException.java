/**
 * Exception thrown when a credential that was provided is invalid.
 * An application's credential may be invalid because it is not in a format
 * that can be interpreted by the service, or if it is not accepted by the
 * smartcard.
 * A smartcard's credential is invalid if it does not correspond with a
 * credential provided by the application. This may be detected if the
 * smartcard has to append a cryptographic MAC (message authentication code)
 * to it's response, and the verification of that MAC fails. Of course, this
 * may also happen if the smartcard's response was modified on it's way
 * to the service.
