/**
 * Manager for logical channels to an inserted smartcard.
 * For each smart card known to the system and in use by some
 * application there is one <tt>CardServiceScheduler</tt> that manages the
 * access to the physical smart card. This is acchieved by allocating the
 * available communication channels to the <tt>CardService</tt>s that want
 * to access the card. The <tt>CardServiceScheduler</tt> takes care of
 * state management and issues such as suspending active and resuming
 * suspended <tt>CardServices</tt>.
 *
 * <p>
 * <i>Note that the current version supports only one logical channel per
 * smart card.</i> To support multiple channels, the internal structure of
 * this class as well as the public interface has to be changed. One
 * way to change the public interface would be to add a method named
 * <tt>setCustomChannels</tt>, which works similiar to
 * <tt>setCustomChannel</tt> but expects an array of channels that
 * have to be managed. A second method to set only the number of
 * channels to manage should then be added, too. In any case, it is
 * a card service factory's responsibility to switch the scheduler
 * to multi-channel support.
