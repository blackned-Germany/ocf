 * <TT>OpenCardConfigurationProvider</TT> is the general interface that has to
 * be implemented by concrete classes that are to set OpenCard's properties.
 * These mechanisms are platform and application dependent and can thus not
 * be offered by the core packages. E.g. the default mechanism to set OpenCard's
 * properties on WinTel systems is to read the 'opencard.properties' file which
 * contains the properties values. On other systems (e.g. on NCs) the properties
 * may (have to) be set differently because there may be no disk at all and
 * therefore no files ...
