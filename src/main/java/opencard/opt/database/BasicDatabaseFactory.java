/**
 * This class is the implementation of a CardServiceFactory that
 * provides access to a BasicDatabase CardService for a smartcard
 * that is compliant with ISO7816-7.
 *
 * @version $Id: BasicDatabaseFactory.java,v 1.1 1999/12/06 15:46:05 damke Exp $<br>
 * Changes: 
 * @author  Christophe.Muller@research.gemplus.com<br>
 *    <ul>
 *    <li> It supports the new style (1.1.1) card recognition (getCardType)
 *    <li> It uses a naming pattern where each CardService that could be
 *         instanciated provides its own <tt>knows</tt> method that does
 *         the card recognition.
 *    <li> It can detect theoritically any smartcard that is ISO7816-7
 *         compliant. To do that it uses a temporary SlotChannel (see
 *         <tt>CardServiceFactory</tt> class) and it:
 *         <ol>
 *            <li>sends a 'PRESENT USER ("PUBLIC")' command w/o password, and
 *            <li>expects a 9000 response.
 *         </ol><br>
 *         See the <tt>knows</tt> method for more details.
 *    </ul><br>
 * Note: For proprietary implementations, i.e., classes inheriting from
 * <tt>Basicdatabase</tt>, it is still possible to redefine an other
 * <tt>knows</tt> method that would be simpler (e.g., that would analyze
 * the card ATR in order to check that the card if of the right type). But
 * in this case, it is also necessary to redefine a factory because the
 * <tt>knows</tt> method is static and so the class exact name must be
 * known and specified by the factory.
