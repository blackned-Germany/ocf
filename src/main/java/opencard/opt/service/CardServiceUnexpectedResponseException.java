/**
 * Exception indicating that a smartcard's response cannot be interpreted.
 * This may be the result of a bug in the card service, or of a mismatch
 * between the smartcard and the service that was used to access it. It may
 * also be the result of a limited implementation, for example one that
 * does not bother to check for the different reasons of a failure.
 * <br>
 * If the response from the smartcard does not indicate success,
 * but is an error response recognized by the service, a
 * <tt>CardServiceOperationFailedException</tt> should be thrown instead.
