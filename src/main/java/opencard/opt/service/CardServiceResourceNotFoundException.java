/**
 * Exception thrown when required resources are not found.
 * This exception can indicate a misuse of a service or service component
 * as well as an error that was not caused by the application.
 * <br>
 * A situation in which this exception would be thrown is a service
 * that supports user friendly names for card objects, and is missing
 * a dictionary to resolve them.
 * The error would have been caused by the application if it did not
 * provide a dictionary. The error would not have been caused by the
 * application if it did provide a URL, and the dictionary could not
 * be loaded due to a network error.
