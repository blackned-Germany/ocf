/**
 * Represents a file or directory on the smartcard.
 * A card file object is a combination of an absolute path to the file
 * represented, and the file information that was obtained from the
 * smartcard on creation of the object. It provides methods to navigate
 * through the smartcard's file system, and to obtain meta information
 * about the files and directories therein. To access file contents,
 * classes like <tt>CardFileInputStream</tt>, <tt>CardFileOutputStream</tt>,
 * <tt>CardRandomByteAccess</tt>, or <tt>CardRandomRecordAccess</tt> can
 * be instantiated.
 *
 * <p>
 * To instantiate class <tt>CardFile</tt>, a <tt>FileAccessCardService</tt>
 * has to be provided. This service is used in the constructor to check
 * whether the file that shall be represented actually exists, and to query
 * meta information about the file. A card file object representing a
 * directory or, in smartcard terminology, a dedicated file (DF), can be
 * used to access other directories or files in the respective subtree of
 * the smartcard's file system. The path names for these files must be
 * relative to the represented directory. An absolute path will be created
 * for newly created card file objects, which will use the same file service
 * that was used by the parent object.
 * <br>
 * Smartcards use 16 bit numbers to identify files and directories. Human
 * friendly names are supported by a software layer, which has no platform
 * dependencies. Card file names are represented by instances of class
 * <tt>CardFilePath</tt>, for which different path components are defined.
 * Class <tt>CardFile</tt> supports only path components that can be
 * interpreted by the underlying file service. These components are
 * file IDs, and optionally short file IDs and application identifiers.
 * The string representation of a file ID is a colon, followed by a four
 * digit hex number specifying the afforementioned 16 bit number. These
 * file IDs can be concatenated to a path, for example <tt>":BEEB:CAFE"</tt>.
 * Support for symbolic path names, like <tt>"/mama/papa/dog"</tt> may be
 * added by derived classes.
 * <br>
 * <tt>CardFilePath</tt> objects can be created directly from strings.
 * To reduce memory requirements and to speed up operation, applications
 * should create each path only once and use it directly later on, instead
 * of using strings and creating paths any time they are needed. To
 * enforce this behavior, only constructors of class <tt>CardFile</tt>
 * accept strings instead of paths. The path created can be obtained
 * using <tt>CardFile.getPath</tt>.
 *
 * <p>
 * Since the path to the file is part of this class, it corresponds to class
 * <tt>java.io.File</tt>. Many of the methods found there are implemented
 * here, too. Some others are implemented with slightly different signatures,
 * but comparable functionality. However, there are significant differences
 * between a standard disk file system and the file system on a smartcard,
 * which are reflected in <tt>CardFile</tt>.
 * <br>
 * Class <tt>java.io.file</tt> represents only a <i>filename</i>, on which
 * symbolic operations can be performed, and which can be used to access an
 * actual file on the underlying file system. Class <tt>CardFile</tt>
 * represents actual files. It cannot be instantiated for files that do not
 * exist. An operation like <tt>exists()</tt> does therefore not make sense.
 * Other examples for methods that are not provided are <tt>renameTo</tt>
 * and both <tt>list</tt> methods, since smartcards do not support file
 * renaming, and typically do not support browsing directories.
 * <br>
 * Traditional disk based file systems maintain file attributes like the
 * time of the last modification, or access conditions. Smartcards do not
 * support creation or modification times, and the access conditions are
 * too complex to be mapped on methods as simple as <tt>canRead</tt> and
 * <tt>canWrite</tt>. Support for platform dependent file separators, which
 * is provided via attributes like <tt>pathSeparator</tt> in class
 * <tt>java.io.File</tt>, do not make sense for smartcards either. The
 * string representation of card file paths is interpreted by a platform
 * neutral software layer.
 *
 * <p>
 * Class <tt>CardFile</tt> provides methods like <tt>create</tt> and
 * <tt>delete</tt>, which are not supported by the interface
 * <tt>FileAccessCardService</tt>. These methods are available only if
 * an implementation of <tt>FileSystemCardService</tt> has been used to
 * create the card file object. This is checked with the Java operator
 * <tt>instanceof</tt>, so the methods may even be available if an
 * application is not aware of it.
 * <br>
 * The assumption for this implementation is that an application that needs
 * creational methods will request a <tt>FileSystemCardService</tt>, while
 * an application that does not need them will not invoke those methods.
 * There is a small chance for programming errors if the file service used
 * for testing implements both interfaces and there is no service that
 * implements only <tt>FileAccessCardService</tt>.
