 * in order to support the corresponding methods in class <tt>CardFile</tt>.

   * Creates a file on the smartcard.
   * Creating files is a card-specific operation. While the ISO file types
   * are specified, the access conditions that can be defined are not. When
   * creating a file, the access conditions to the new file have to be given.
   * The result is that no card-independent arguments to a <tt>create</tt>
   * method can be specified.
   * <br>
   * This method defines only a card-neutral <i>signature</i> by expecting
   * a byte array as a parameter. The data to be stored in that byte array
   * is card-specific. It is suggested, but not required, that a file header,
   * as it is returned by <tt>CardFileInfo.getHeader</tt>, is accepted as
   * that parameter block. A file header typically holds all information
   * needed for creating a file, in a card-specific encoding. This information
   * includes the file ID, structure, size, and the access conditions.
   * <p>
   * This method is intended to be used in a scenario where new applications
   * have to be downloaded on a smartcard. Typically, a server will be
   * contacted to retrieve the information about the directories and files
   * that have to be created. This server can be supplied with the card's ATR,
   * which is encapsulated by class <tt>CardID</tt>. The server will then be
   * able to send parameter blocks that are appropriate arguments for this
   * method and the respective card.
   *
   * @param parent   the path to the directory in which to create a new file
   * @param data     the parameters specifying the file to create.
   *                 This argument is card-specific. Refer to the documentation
   *                 of the card-specific service for details.
