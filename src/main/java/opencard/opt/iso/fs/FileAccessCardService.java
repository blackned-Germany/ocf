/**
 * Interface to a card service for ISO 7816-4 file access functionality.
 * This service provides read and write access to transparent as well as
 * to structured files. In addition, there are methods to check whether
 * a file exists and to access information stored in a file header. Both
 * methods can be mapped onto the ISO-specified SELECT command.
 * <br>
 * This is a low-level interface that requires careful programming when
 * used directly. Especially the <tt>CardFilePath</tt> objects used for
 * identifying files on the smartcard are somehow tricky, as described
 * below. Higher level access is provided by classes like <tt>CardFile</tt>,
 * <tt>CardFileInputStream</tt>, <tt>CardFileOutputStream</tt>,
 * <tt>CardRandomByteAccess</tt>, or <tt>CardRandomRecordAccess</tt>.
 * They can be created on top of a <tt>FileAccessCardService</tt>.
 * The rest of this comment specifies the conditions that have to be
 * satisfied if this interface is implemented or used directly.
 *
 * <p> <hr>
 * <tt>CardFilePath</tt> objects, which are used as arguments in almost
 * all methods, are mutable. Since they are first class candidates for
 * keys in hashtables, there are some conditions that must be satisfied
 * by applications as well as by card services. For the card service side,
 * there are two restrictions:
 * <ol>
 * <li> A path given as an argument must not be modified by the service.
 *      If modifications to the path are necessary, it has to be copied,
 *      and the copy can be modified. Therefore, an application can rely
 *      on the path to be the same before and after an invocation of a
 *      card service method.
 *      </li>
 * <li> A path given as an argument may be modified by the application
 *      after the invoked card service method returned. If a card service
 *      needs to store a path across invocations, for example for caching
 *      purposes, the path has to be copied and the copy can be stored.
 *      Therefore, an application is allowed to modify a path, regardless
 *      of whether it has been used as an argument to a card service or
 *      not.
 *      </li>
 * </ol>
 * The restrictions imposed on applications are more complex. However,
 * these are <i>common sense</i> restrictions that will typically be
 * satisfied by any reasonable application program. As a rule of thumb,
 * path supplied as arguments must be as simple as possible, but not
 * simpler. These kind of paths are referred to as <i>canonical paths</i>.
 * <ol>
 * <li> A path given as an argument to a card service must be <i>absolute</i>.
 *      If the path consists only of file ids and short file ids, the first
 *      component of the path must be the id of the master file (MF). A path
 *      to the MF can be obtained by invoking <tt>getRoot</tt>. This path
 *      can then be copied and extended.
 *      <br>
 *      A path that contains an application identifier is implicitly
 *      absolute, since application identifiers are supported only as
 *      the first component in a path. Hierarchical applications are not
 *      supported by OCF, even if a smartcard does. There may be additional
 *      restrictions imposed on the layout of smartcards to enforce a
 *      correct behavior of card services.
 *      <br>
 *      This restriction guarantees to the card service that selection of
 *      the full path will select the correct file on the smartcard, no
 *      matter what file has been selected before.
 *      </li>
 * <li> A path given as an argument to a card service must be <i>straight</i>.
 *      It is not allowed for a path to switch to parent directories, even
 *      if the smartcard would support this feature. It is also unacceptable
 *      to include the master file in a path, unless it is the first component.
 *      <br>
 *      This restriction almost guarantees to the card service that any file
 *      on the smartcard is identified by a unique path. The path can therefore
 *      be used as a key in hashtables or other dictionaries that store
 *      information related to a file. It is also possible to cut off the
 *      leading components of a path if the path to the currently selected
 *      directory (DF) is a prefix of the path to select. Besides, this
 *      restriction reduces memory consumption and speeds up operations.
 *      </li>
 * <li> If a file on the smartcard is referenced by a path with an application
 *      name, it should not be referenced by another path without application
 *      name. Together with the preceeding restriction, this basically means:
 *      a file on the smartcard should be referenced by a unique identifier.
 *      The reason for this has been mentioned in the preceeding restriction.
 *      <br>
 *      In this last restriction, the term <i>should</i> is used instead of
 *      <i>must</i>. This is because an application programmer cannot know
 *      about the potential programmers of other applications that refer to
 *      the same file on the card. One could decide to use a path with an
 *      application name, while another one could decide to use a path with
 *      file ids only.
 *      <br>
 *      In this case, if both applications run simultaneously, and the card
 *      services created for them use a shared data structure like a file
 *      cache, the same file may be referenced by two different paths. This
 *      could lead to inconsistencies in the shared data, for example if one
 *      of the applications deletes the file. However, this case is too
 *      unlikely to worry about.
 *      <br>
 *      If different card services, or different instances of one card
 *      service, use the same smartcard without cooperating on shared data,
 *      inconsistencies in cached data cannot be avoided at all, no matter
 *      what restrictions are put on path names.
 *      </li>
 * </ol>
