/**
 * Provides information about the structure of a file.
 * File information is obtained from the smartcard by <i>selecting</i>
 * a file. The file may be a dedicated file (DF, also referred to as
 * directory) or an elementary file (EF). The smartcard typically responds
 * with the selected file's header.
 * <br>
 * Unlike the select command itself, the file header is not subject to
 * standards, so it cannot be encapsulated in a predefined class. This
 * interface defines some methods that should be implementable regardless
 * of the particular card and it's select response. Most of these methods
 * provide information about the structure of an elementary file.
 * <br>
 * The comments to the methods required by this interface assume knowledge
 * of the file types defined by ISO 7816. Some information about these file
 * types can be found in the comments to <tt>FileAccessCardService</tt>.
 * The term <i>the file</i>, which is frequently used in the comments,
 * refers to the file on the smartcard for which an instance of this
 * interface provides information.
