/** <tt>KeyGenerationCardService</tt>
 * The SignatureCardService offers methods to generate and verify a signature
 * as well as key import, verification and generation methods. Many smartcard
 * applications will work with existing keys imported during initialization or
 * personalization instead of importing/generating them at runtime. Thus the
 * functionality for
 * <ul>
 * <li>signature generation and verification
 * <li>key import and verification
 * <li>key generation
 * </ul>
 * is split into three interfaces "SignatureCardService", "KeyImportCardService"
 * and "KeyGenerationCardService". Card service realizations of these interfaces
 * need only implement the functionality needed by the application or supported
 * by the specific card. This solution also offers potential for downsizing
 * opencard for use in embedded devises with small memory resources.
