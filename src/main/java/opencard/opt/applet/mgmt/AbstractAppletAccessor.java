/**
 * The <tt>AbstractAppletAccessor</tt> is an abstract class providing
 * card type independent base functionality for implementations of an
 * <tt>AppletAccessCardService</tt>. It is however an adapter in the sense
 * that it implements a part of the <tt>AppletAccessCardService></tt>
 * interface and provide the following implementations which can be useful
 * for concrete implementations of the <tt>AppletAccessCardService</tt>
 * interface:
 * <ul>
 * <li> A <tt>selectApplet</tt> method that uses ISO-standardized APDU code.
 *      Note: this particular feature is accessed through a helper
 *      object that is by default an "<tt>ISOAppletSelector</tt>" but can
 *      be changed by subclasses with <tt>setAppletSelector</tt>.
 * <li> A method to "list" the available applets on the card. Note that
 *      although this method is implemented, it relies on the fact that
 *      an abstract "internalList" method must be implemented by subclasses
 *      and called before it, this is why the class is an "abstract" one.
 * <li> A method "getInfo" to get the related AppletInfo object of a
 *      specific applet specified by AID.
 * <li> A method "exists" to check if a specified applet (given its AID)
 *      is available on the card. It relies on internalList as well.
 * </ul>
