/**
 * A card service for low level communication with smartcards.
 * It allows to send application-provided command APDUs to the card and
 * returns the response APDUs. The factory that creates this service is
 * <tt>PassThruCardServiceFactory</tt>.
 * <br>
 * This class serves as an example how a card service can be implemented.
 * However, it contradicts the idea of card services. The responsibility
 * for composing the APDUs sent to the card and interpreting the responses
 * lies with the card services, not with the application.
 * Since most people start getting familiar with smartcards by building
 * APDUs themselves, this service is provided here as a "quick starter"
 * for some test programs. Nevertheless, it's use is strongly discouraged
 * when implementing real applications.
 * <br>
 * OpenCard applications should <b>never</b> build APDUs, since APDUs are
 * card specific. The same applies to interpreting the responses received
 * from the smartcard. Instead, they should use high-level interfaces that
 * can be implemented for different cards. These interfaces can be standard
 * interfaces, like <tt>FileAccessCardService</tt> for ISO compatible, file
 * system based smartcards, or they can be defined by an application.
 *
 * <p>
 * When designing an application that supports smartcards, there will
 * typically be a need for two kinds of card specific code. First, the
 * ATR sent by a smartcard has to be interpreted to make sure that the
 * card inserted is supported by the application. An OCF application
 * should put the respective code into a card service factory, or use an
 * existing factory that knows the ATR(s).
 * <br>
 * The second part of the card specific code will build command APDUs and
 * interpret responses to these commands. This part of the code can provide
 * rather general operations, like <i>select a file</i> or <i>read some
 * data from a file</i>. In this case, a standard interface should be used.
 * On the other hand, this part of the code can also provide specialized
 * functionality, like <i>read the serial number</i> or <i>read the card
 * holder's name</i>. In this case, the application should define it's own
 * interface, and a card service implementing this interface has to be
 * developed.
 * <br>
 * Later on, if another card with different APDUs and responses has to be
 * supported by the same application, just a service for that new card has
 * to be developed, implementing the same interface as the first one. The
 * factory used to create the first service will be extended, so it can
 * decide which service to use, depending on a smartcard's ATR. The
 * application itself does not have to be changed at all.
