/**
 * A container for cryptographic credentials.
 * Smartcards may protect access to the data stored on them by means of
 * cryptography. The card services that are used to access that data will
 * then require credentials to overcome this protection. The cryptographic
 * algorithms that have to be used depend on the smartcard's OS. The kind
 * of credential that has to be presented to the card service depends on
 * the algorithm to support as well as on the service. For example, if the
 * algorithm is DES, the credential may be a DES key, or an implementation
 * of the DES algorithm for a specific key.
 * <br>
 * As a result of these dependencies, card services supporting a particular
 * smartcard or smartcard family will define specific credentials that have
 * to be provided to them. Additionally, they will define a store into which
 * only these credentials can be put. This class is the abstract base class
 * of such stores. Methods to put credentials into it as well as to retrieve
 * them have to be added in dervied classes, since at least the type of the
 * credentials is service specific.
 * <br>
 * Applications will collect their credentials for a specific smartcard in
 * a credential store. Credential stores are collected in instances of class
 * <tt>CredentialBag</tt>, so the same application may support different
 * smartcards without having to worry about which one is inserted.
