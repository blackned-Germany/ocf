/**
 * A card service interface for Card Holder Verification (CHV).
 * CHV is typically performed by querying a password or PIN
 * (Personal Identification Number) from the user and presenting
 * it to the card for verification. The user's input has to be
 * converted into the format understood by the smartcard, for
 * example by BCD-packing and padding a PIN. The methods in this
 * interface expect this converted data, which is referred to as
 * <i>password</i>. Please note that there is no assumption on how
 * the password data is obtained and preprocessed. For example,
 * biometric scanning could be used instead of querying a PIN.
