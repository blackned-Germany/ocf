 * Credential used by a card service to sign a block of data

 * External authentication means that the outside world (the application)
 * authenticates itself by encrypting a challenge (random number) that the card
 * sends to the application.
 * The algorithm used to sign the challenge can either be a symmetric
 * algorithm like DES or an asymmetric public key algorithm (PKA) like RSA.
 * The SignCredential can only sign challenges that match its defined
 * input length (it does neither compute a hash nor pad data).
 * Padding of the challenge up to the defined input length is card specific
 * and is done by the card service.
