/**
 * A tag interface for cryptographic credentials.
 * Most smartcards are able to protect the access to the data stored on
 * them by means of cryptography. In order to overcome such protection,
 * the terminal side of an application will have to provide some kind of
 * secret data to the card services it is using. That secret data is
 * referred to as credentials. Credentials are collected in instances
 * of class <tt>CredentialStore</tt>.
 * <br>
 * Credentials can take different formats, depending on the smartcard used
 * as well as on the card service that provides access to the smartcard.
 * For example, a credential may be a key to the DES or 3DES algorithm, or a
 * private key to the RSA algorithm.
 * It does not even have to be a simple key. For example, a credential may
 * provide the implementation of the algorithm, like DES or 3DES, along with
 * the key.
 * A card service requiring such a credential will define an interface,
 * extending this one, which provides the cryptographic operations. These
 * operations are then executed by invoking the application's credential.
 * <br>
 * Encapsulating the algorithm within the credential has several advantages.
 * First of all, the terminal application does not have to provide the secret
 * data to the service directly. Second, the credential can be implemented as
 * a pure software solution, optionally using a cryptographic framework like
 * the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE), but it may also use a hardware
 * implementation of the cryptographic algorithm. The card services will
 * not have to be adapted to the platform in order to make use of such
 * frameworks or special hardware. Last but not least, card services that
 * include cryptographic code are subject to US export restrictions.
 *
 * <p>
 * Since there are few cryptographic algorithms ferquently used by smartcards,
 * namely DES and 3DES, credential interfaces for these algorithms may be
 * defined by OCF in the future.
