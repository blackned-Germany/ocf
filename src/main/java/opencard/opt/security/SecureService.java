/**
 * An interface for card services with cryptographic security mechanisms.
 * It defines a standard way to pass credentials to a card service. It does
 * not define any methods that could be used to access the smartcard.
 * Therefore, it does not make sense for an application to request a card
 * service that implements this interface.
 * <br>
 * Applications have to provide credentials to card services in order to
 * satisfy access conditions involving cryptography. The credentials are
 * collected in card-specific credential stores, which are collected in
 * credential bags. The bag is what has to be provided to the card service.
 * <br>
 * One example for a card service that extends this interface is the service
 * that provides access to ISO file systems, <tt>FileAccessCardService</tt>.
 * Other services that require credentials should extend it, too. An
 * application can then check by the <tt>instanceof</tt> operator whether
 * a service may need credentials or not. Card service implementors can
 * either support the credentials provided in opencard.opt.security or 
 * support credentials in a base class common to all services that need them.
 * <br>
 * Smartcards that support cryptographic security typically support different
 * key domains. For example, file system based smartcards use elementary
 * files to store keys, and in each directory, different keys may be defined.
 * The card resident parts of each application supported by a smartcard will
 * be stored in an application directory, so each application can use it's
 * private credentials. Therefore, along with the credential bag to use, a
 * security domain has to be given. The security domain can for example bed
 * specified by a path to the directory in which the application resides.
 * <br>
 * SecurityDomain is simply a tag interfaces for classes which can be used
 * to identify a security domain. Different card services may support 
 * different types of SecurityDomain. For file system based smartcards
 * class opencard.opt.iso.fs.CardFilePath implements the SecurityDomain interface.
