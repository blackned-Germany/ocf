/**
 * A container for stores that hold cryptographic credentials.
 * Smartcards may protect access to the data stored on them by means of
 * cryptography. Applications have to provide cryptographic credentials
 * to the card services they are using, so the services can overcome this
 * protection. The credentials for a particular smartcard are collected
 * in instances of class <tt>CredentialStore</tt>. These stores are
 * collected in instances of this class.
 * <br>
 * An application that supports different smartcards will set up a store
 * for each of the cards. Then, it puts all these stores into a bag. This
 * bag is passed to the card service that is used to access a particular
 * smartcard that has been inserted. The card service will pick the right
 * store from the bag and use the credentials in that store. That way, the
 * application does not have to worry about which particular card it is
 * currently working with.
