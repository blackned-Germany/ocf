/** Contains a public DSA key.
  * Implements the java.security.interfaces.DSAPrivateKey interface
  * CardServices using PKA algorithms like SignatureCardService require
  * keys implementing the PrivateKey/PublicKey interface.
  * In this package OpenCard provides key classes for common algorithms
  * like RSA, DSA (or DES) that each concrete card service implementing
  * a card service interface should support instead of defining its own
  * key classes.
  * Only for new PKA algorithms that OpenCard does not yet support a
  * card service may define its own key classes.
