/**
 * SecurityDomain is a tag interface for classes which can be used
 * to identify a security domain. Different card services may support 
 * different types of SecurityDomain. For file system based smartcards
 * class opencard.opt.iso.fs.CardFilePath implements the SecurityDomain interface.
 * <br>
 * SecurityDomains are used to provide credentials to a CardService 
 * implementing the SecureService interface.
