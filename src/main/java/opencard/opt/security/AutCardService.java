/*
 * A card service interface for authentication of card and outside world.
 * SmartCards typically support <i>external authentication</i> and
 * <i>internal authentication</i>. External authentication means that
 * the outside world authenticates itself against the card. The card
 * may request this kind of authentication before giving access to
 * data stored on it.
 * <br>
 * On the other hand, internal authentication means that the card
 * authenticates itself against the outside world. This is one way
 * for a host or terminal application (being part of the outside world)
 * to detect and reject forged smartcards.
